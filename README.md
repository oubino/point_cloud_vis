## Development

Create empty environment with python 3.7 as this is the requirement for pptk.

```
pip install pptk
pip install open3d
```

Create pptk.py file to experiment with pptk.
Create open3d.py file to experiment with open3d.

Wanted to use my package therefore built smlm_cloud on python 3.9 then upgrade python to 3.9 for render.
Then moved the wheel file and pip installed it


## WSL 2 issue

Had issue where GUI closes in WSL - is a wsl bug
Updating wsl seemed to fix issue but be aware!
